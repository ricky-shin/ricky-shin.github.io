    <p>A website dedicated to charting the COVID-19 pandemic, more specifically in New York City. The website fetches and charts data without a backend. Built using JavaScript.</p>
    <p><u>The Inspiration</u>: With the COVID-19 pandemic well underway, the NYC Department of Health began releasing pertinent data on GitHub in late March. Realizing the potential to tell a story using the data, I created <a href="https://www.covidinnyc.com/" target="_blank">COVIDinNYC.com</a>.</p>
    <p><u>The Challenge</u>: Rather than simply charting the data (which the NYC Department of Health had already <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page" target="_blank">done</a>), I wanted to compare the data given by the Department of Health with other data sets. </p>
    <h4>Challenges</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>No Backend Wanted<ul><li>Because of the way the Department of Health decided to release the data (a .csv on GitHub), I decided to use JavaScript to fetch the data and chart them. <ul><li>This allowed me to avoid hosting the website on a virtual machine, instead hosting it on GitHub Pages for free. <li>This also meant that should the Department of Health decide to change the model of the data in the .csv's, my website would break.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
        <li>Interactive Charts <ul><li>What's awesome about front-end development is allowing visitors to interact with data. This manipulation of data allows users to better understand the data they're seeing, and I saw it as a crucial feature for the website. Keeping that in mind, I began searching for JS charting libraries, and went with <a href="https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js" target="_blank">chart.js </a></li></ul></li>
        <li>Adding/Subtracting Dates<ul><li>A necessary requirement in the making of the "<a href="https://www.covidinnyc.com/#pueyo" target="_blank">Pueyo Estimate</a>" model was allowing users to select different variables to see different projections. One of these variables was dates. I soon became very aware of the headaches associated with adding/subtracting dates and time. <ul><li>To solve this issue, I implemented <a href="https://momentjs.com/" target="_blank">moment.js</a> </li></ul></li></ul></li>
