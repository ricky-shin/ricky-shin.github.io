    <p>The Food Pantry at Columbia is a student-run, non-profit organization under the purview of Columbia University.
        The Pantry distributes foods and vouchers to students affilated with Columbia University.</p>
    <p><u>The Problem</u>: Before I came on board, many of the operational tasks (inventorying, assignment and food
        distribution) within the Pantry were done manually. This operational method proved to be unsustainable with
        the increase of disbursement requests following the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p><u>The Solution</u>: A new eCommerce platform that allows inventorying, product management, student data
        retention, back-end management and more - built off WordPress, WooCommerce and custom plugins made specifically
        for the Pantry.</p>
    <h4>Challenges</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Working Remotely (Start to Finish)
            <ul>
                <li>I joined the Pantry during my summer break during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic here in New
                    York and began working on the project completely remotely.</li>
                <li>While this was not my first time working remotely in a team environment, it was my first time
                    creating a new platform and launching it remotely.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Using Amazon Web Services (AWS)
            <ul>
                <li>Because Columbia University and AWS has an enterprise agreement and consolidated billing, it made
                    sense to run all technical services through AWS instead of using an outside provider. This was
                    challenging as this project was my first exposure to AWS.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Services used: AWS LightSail, AWS SES, AWS Route 53</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Development and Launch
            <ul>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ol>
